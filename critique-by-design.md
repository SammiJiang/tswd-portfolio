# Critique by Design Assignment: improvement on "Confirmed COVID–19 cases last week vs the week before"
## the original design
- source: https://blog.datawrapper.de/coronaviruscharts/
- original data source: https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19

This table compares the new reported COVID–19 cases in the last seven days (between 8 days ago and yesterday) with the new reported cases in the seven days before that, and reveals which country has the most deathes in this period. 
### Problem with this original visulization: 
- **Informative**: The original graph just have too much information to follow, if we only speak from the perspective of informative, the graph definitely provides tons of information
- **Usefulness**: assume the target audience is scholars who study for covid, the trend maybe very usesul. 
- **Completeness**: the graph did have all the element of a completing setting. Although it was very hard to understand, but if you read closely, you will understand the points that author want to make 
- **Perceptibility**: very low given too much information 
- **Truthfulness**: given the data source is from JHU, it's a truthful data
- **Intuitiveness**: the intutiveness of this graph is very low because it has too much information such that it's hard to understand which point does the author want to enphasize 
- **Aesthetics**: limited colors are used here, thus the Aesthetics is poor. 
- **Engagement**: due to too much information, low enegagment could be scored to the graph. 
## Redesign process: 
given the evaluation above, we need to change the following perspective of the original design, which are **Informative**, **Usefulness**,**Perceptibility**,**Intuitiveness**,**Aesthetics**,**Engagement**. such that a simpler design could be implemented. To achieve this goal, I will delete the last 3 columns: change, total confirmed case, and the case on yesterday. To make the contrast between "this week" and "the week before", I will use bar graph to emphasize the contrast on number. Also, I will change the order of the graph, rank the death from the highest to lowest in order to make the contrast more obvious. I will also change the color to increase aesthetic. Originally, only grey is used here, thus decreasing the aesthetics. The last thinng I will change is to empathize japan instead of other countries: here is the reasoning: if the target audience is sholars who study for covid trends in general, only empathize on Europe is usefullessness. which is to say if the sholar only want to study european countries, there is no need to list other countries.
