Many countries are experiencing an increase in government debt, with Japan, the USA, and some European nations having particularly noticeable rises.

## Sustainable Growth of Japan 
Japan has a massive amount of government debt, which is more than 2.3 times its GDP. To address this issue, Japan maintains low interest rates on government bonds and maintains investor confidence to prevent default.

## A Threat to the Eurozone
PIGS(Portugal, Italy, Greece, Spain) are famous for their financial crisis and bad impact to EU Zone. Countries in the Eurozone are questioning the single currency policy due to the financial difficulties faced by the PIGS. They are also concerned about the inability to adapt their economic policies to meet their individual national needs

# Why I choose those graph? 

**Grid View by Flourish**: the grid view provides a perfect overview of the trends for current debt to GDP ratio globally. Users could feel free to have a glance to the country they interested in, and its trend is intuitive. However, to polish the graph and add more ad hoc study to other countries, redesign would be a good idea. 

**Bar Chart by OECD**: The second chart was created using the OECD data website's built-in interactive chart tool. The website's limited filtering and highlighting options prevented me from presenting the data in the desired manner, so I used it to focus on the PIGS, which I could adequately display with the available features. Also the websites provides a AVG column to reference with, which shows a great comparison between PIGS and the average ratio. Also I really like how OECD mark the average as black, it both helps mark the average as well as  keep users focus on PIGS without get distraction. 

**Line Graph by Flourish**:  In comparison to OECD data website, Flourish provided a wide range of customization options. The line chart is doing a great job on let Japan stand out from other countries. I mark the Japan as red not only because red intuitively means bad, but also because the red is on Japanâ€™s national flag. Also the trend of drastically increasing is well repressed by using line plot.
