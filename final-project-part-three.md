# The final data story
[Final Story](https://app.shorthand.com/organisations/JSrgFWI7zn/stories/AUe67PtFpO)



# Changes made since Part II
## Summary and transition from Part1
- I decide the topic related to vegetarian based on the my experience of having impossible foods. I have not narrowed down the topic by then. I do have several thought based on my research 
  - 1. A lot of people hate vegeatables
  - 2. I conduct a lot of market research on impossible products and I found we did have a good trends of increasing market size in US, a lot of visualization regarding the market trend has been scratched. 
- After have the general idea, I am thinking of bring all those ideas to a complete story. Combing with my own experience, I decide to portrait the story along with my journey of being “vegetarian”. 
  - In the first part, I plan to introduce the fact that vegetable is not a popular item. I tried to find resources of the number of vegetairans in US, why people hate vegetalbes, etc.
  - After that, luckily I found a support document that indicating people hate vegetables mainly becasue of terrible taste. That is perfect becasue that’s why impossible product exists 
- The second part of my presentation is related to introduction to the impossible products, and extensive amount of information has been searched. I tried to focus on the following field of impossible products 
  - How it improved the taste? 
  - Why competition contribute to the development of impossible products? 
  - How customer benefits fron the competition
- My call to action here is just give a try! Since my target audience is everyone who want to become vegetarian but afraid of the Terrible taste

- In the second part of the project, the first step was to build a storyboard. The aim was to create a visual representation of the narrative that would be used to convey the project's message to the target audience.
- Shorthand was used to construct the narrative, which involved integrating a combination of text, images, and visualizations. Flourish and Tableau were utilized to create visualizations that could be integrated into the storyboard
- Relevant text and images were added to the storyboard, with the aim of creating a compelling story that would resonate with the target audience. This was achieved by considering the preferences and expectations of the audience
- To ensure that the storyboard resonated with the target audience, 6 of my friends were contacted to provide feedback on the storyboard. As the target audience was general audience/who want to try impossible products, it was appropriate to ask them at the end of the interview if they are motivated or not
- Before reaching out to the interviewees, an interview script was prepared with a list of questions. The questions were designed to understand different aspects of the storyboard and the message it was trying to convey. The goal was to obtain comprehensive feedback that could be used to improve the storyboard.
- After receiving feedback from the interviewees, the storyboard was updated to reflect the suggestions and recommendations provided. This was done with the goal of enhancing the quality of the storyboard and making it more appealing to the target audience.
- The updated storyboard was subjected to another round of review by classmates. Multiple rounds of feedback were considered the best way to improve the work as it provided a diverse range of perspectives and insights.
- Finally, after receiving all the feedback, a plan was laid out for Part 3 of the project. The plan was created with specific emphasis on the changes that needed to be made in the project. The goal was to ensure that the project was improved based on the feedback received.


## The audience
In Part 3 of the project, I wanted to ensure that my storyboard was specifically tailored to my intended audience, people interested in becoming vegetarians. I made several changes to further narrow my focus on this target audience.
To provide additional visualizations that would help my audience understand the benefits of becoming a vegetarian, I added a couple of visualizations that explained the health benefits of vegetables through a word cloud. By using a word cloud, I was able to emphasize the importance of vegetables in a visually appealing manner. I also limited the use of multiple colors as much as possible, and instead used colors that focused on the green theme. By doing so, I was able to convey the message that green vegetables are essential for a healthy lifestyle.
To ensure that my audience could understand the message of the visualizations without having to listen to my presentation, I added a sentence summarizing the primary point of each visualization in maroon. This was done to provide clarity and ensure that my audience could easily understand the main message of each visualization.
Finally, to make the call-to-action section of my storyboard more useful for my intended audience, I added valuable resources to help them prepare and find an easier way to execute the call to action. By providing these resources, I hoped to motivate my audience to take action and become vegetarians. These resources focused on providing tips and tricks on how to start the vegetarian journey, easy vegetarian recipes, and a list of online communities where they could find support and connect with like-minded people.
Overall, these changes helped to make my storyboard more effective and engaging for my intended audience. By tailoring my storyboard to my target audience, I was able to provide them with the information and resources they needed to start their vegetarian journey.



## Final design decisions
### The visulization improvement 
After the first round of interview,  A consturcive feedback I have been received is that the title of my visulziation does not corporate with my words explanation in the webpage. For example, explanation of the graph and the subtitle in the graph does ot coherent together. I realized an important factor that doing visualization here is a little different from what we did for homework 3 and 4 that we are not visuluzalied a single story, but instead the coherence here is very important. Thus I change the layout and delete couple of subtitle for the graph. 
Too complex infprmaton represented in the graph. There was one graph that I used in my presentation that relate to all CO2 Generate through the whole supply chain for one product , including progress of farming,packaging, selling and etc. With multiple products and multiple process in supply chain, I have to use a lot of colors and it looks bad. Thus I received feedback that the graph looks super confusing and I delete the each progress on the supply chain and only left with the sum of Co2 in the supply chain 
### Confusing of the graph “Market trend of US”
I received feedback of why presenting the total market size of impossible products here in US. I realized I need to write more paragraph explaining everything. I also add graph about the brand distribution and product distribution in US to illustrate the point of Since we have a promising market-> a lot of player are competing with each other to attract customers-> increase choice for customers->customer gain better experience of having those food. 
I also change the layout. Although I relly like the effect of Zoom in and Zoom out! I decide the delete the effect and add pure text section to make everything work and has a solid logic flow. 
### More actionable “Call to action”
I also received the feedback of I should add more actionable event. An easy way to do that is to find something more easier to do. Thus I list starbucks as an option and list the price option to motivate others to try to taste the impossible products 
Also I add graph to describe that PA is a vegetarian friendly state that means it’s simple to find a vegetarian restaurant here in Pittsburgh to illustrate that it’s easy to experience the difference . 
### Recitation
I did not put reference on part 2 because of I have constantly increasing source/reference. The official reference are listed here.

# Final thoughts
Throughout this project, I faced challenges in narrowing down the topic, as I aimed to convey the broad concept of eating more vegetables and adopting a vegetarian lifestyle. The process of finding suitable data was time-consuming, and I encountered several facts about taste that were presented in the form of text files. To effectively analyze this data, I utilized a significant amount of natural language processing techniques to convert the information into a comprehensive word cloud.

Furthermore, this project taught me the importance of copyright, something I had not considered before when conducting web research. It was a valuable lesson that underscored the significance of citing images and giving proper credit where it is due. This experience helped me gain a deeper understanding of ethical research practices and the need to respect the hard work and efforts of content creators.

In summary, this project presented several challenges, from narrowing down the topic to analyzing complex data. However, it also provided opportunities for growth and learning, such as the application of natural language processing techniques and the importance of copyright and ethical research practices. Through this experience, I gained valuable insights that will be useful in future endeavors.
