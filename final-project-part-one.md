# Outline
> Include a high-level summary of your project.  This should be a couple paragraphs that describe what you're interested in showing with your final project. 
> 
 Because of my Religion belief in Taoism, I begin to try to become a vegetarian in the past of the two weeks. I realized that being a vegetarian is not as hard as I thought. So I am here to present several benefits of eating vegetables for a couple of while in your life,and also sharing my personal story of eating vegetables. I am going to share the story from the following perspectives: 
 - Health: Studying vegetarian diets can help us understand the health benefits and potential risks associated with this type of eating pattern.
 - Environmental sustainability: The meat industry has a significant impact on the environment, including deforestation, water usage, and greenhouse gas emissions. Studying vegetarianism can help us understand the potential environmental benefits of reducing meat consumption.
 - Market trends of impossible products: With the rise of plant-based diets and the growing popularity of meat alternatives, studying vegetarianism can provide valuable insights into market trends and consumer preferences.

Overall, studying vegetarianism can help us better understand the health, environmental, ethical, and economic implications of this type of dietary choice, and inform public health and sustainability initiatives.



> A project structure that outlines the major elements of your story.  Your Good Charts text talks about story structure in Chapter 8 - you should describe what you hope to achieve.  Make sure the outline is detailed enough that we can see how you anticipate your story unfolding.  You can incorporate your Story Arc from the in-class exercise along with your user stories and one sentence summary to make the topic even more clear.

- Setup: For the setup, I would highlight a few statistics of what is the percentage of vegetarians worldwide and the percentage of people who become vegetarian because of religious belief.  These would include the total number of vegetarians worldwide in 2022 and the total number of vegetarians based on religion. 
- Conflict: I would move on with visualizing the trends of impossible products. A lot of people are afraid of being a vegetarian because of limited food choices. I would highlight the number of companies that operate in the industries of impossible products and the proportion of product distributions in the US. I am also going to share the variety of products to attract an audience. 
- Resolution: I highlight the fact that impossible meat tastes almost identical to the real meat and will provide even more protein. And I also put other dairy products (soybean products) to even increase the variety of the diet of vegetarians. In the last, although a lot of people heard of this, I still want to point out other benefits of being vegetarian such as healthier/ less carbon footprint. 
- Audience:  The primary audience of this project are those who wants to try becoming vegetarian but limited by food choice.

## Initial sketches
> Post images of your anticipated data visualizations (sketches are fine). They should mimic aspects of your outline, and include elements of your story.

> A couple of paragraphs that document your data source(s), and an explanation of how you plan on using your data. 

- Data source1: Statistia: 
link: https://www.statista.com/topics/8771/veganism-and-vegetarianism-worldwide/#editorsPicks
- This is my primary data with market trend of the impossible meat market trends in the past 5 years and some of the future predictions 
- I will used a lot of data in the dataset to visualize the future trends of the Impossible Meat market, including the following: 
- more and more products in the future 
- more and more restaurants distributed in the future 
- more and more brand begin to enter into the market, thus the total revenue is predicted to increase in the future
- All those trends imply the fact that the variety of products of impossible products will increase in the future. Comeptition is always good for customers 
 
 - Data source2: https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/11/1/29
This is a acedemic research paper about benefits of eating vegetables. It's contain analysis regarding some facts sheet of the impact for having different diet. (Also divide those for different gender)
it is a good illustration of the benefits for eating vegeatables: I plan to draw couple of bar graph that describe the health outcome of being vegetarian vs. meat eater 


- Data source3: https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaq0216
this is a acedemic paper provides fact sheet of the different carbon footprint through the supplychain of selling grocery. 
A brief outcome of using this dataset is that through the whole supplychain, vegetables will generate less co2 emission compare to the meat. Thus I would like to use it to draw a stacked bar graph that visualize the trend I describe above 


# Method and medium
> In a few sentences, you should document how you plan on completing your final project. 

In the future, I will enhance my visualizations by creating an interactive version of the all the graphs above using the Flourish. I may also create sub-treemaps to generalize the distribution of producers in the treemap. I will use Shorthand to develop my narrative and Flourish to develop my visualizations, but I will consider Tableau if needed. I plan to use attractive license-free images by Unsplash for my final project's narrative.
