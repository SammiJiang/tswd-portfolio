# Outline
> Include a high-level summary of your project.  This should be a couple paragraphs that describe what you're interested in showing with your final project. 
 Because of my Religion belief in Taoism, I begin to try to become a vegetarian in the past of the two weeks. I realized that being a vegetarian is not as hard as I thought. So I am here to present several benefits of eating vegetables for a couple of while in your life,and also sharing my personal story of eating vegetables. I am going to share the story from the following perspectives: 
 - Health: Studying vegetarian diets can help us understand the health benefits and potential risks associated with this type of eating pattern.
 - Environmental sustainability: The meat industry has a significant impact on the environment, including deforestation, water usage, and greenhouse gas emissions. Studying vegetarianism can help us understand the potential environmental benefits of reducing meat consumption.
 - Market trends of impossible products: With the rise of plant-based diets and the growing popularity of meat alternatives, studying vegetarianism can provide valuable insights into market trends and consumer preferences.

Overall, studying vegetarianism can help us better understand the health, environmental, ethical, and economic implications of this type of dietary choice, and inform public health and sustainability initiatives.

 

> A project structure that outlines the major elements of your story.  Your Good Charts text talks about story structure in Chapter 8 - you should describe what you hope to achieve.  Make sure the outline is detailed enough that we can see how you anticipate your story unfolding.  You can incorporate your Story Arc from the in-class exercise along with your user stories and one sentence summary to make the topic even more clear.

- Setup: For the setup, I would highlight a few statistics of what is the percentage of vegetarians worldwide and the percentage of people who become vegetarian because of religious belief.  These would include the total number of vegetarians worldwide in 2022 and the total number of vegetarians based on religion. 
- Conflict: I would move on with visualizing the trends of impossible products. A lot of people are afraid of being a vegetarian because of limited food choices. I would highlight the number of companies that operate in the industries of impossible products and the proportion of product distributions in the US. I am also going to share the variety of products to attract an audience. 
- Resolution: I highlight the fact that impossible meat tastes almost identical to the real meat and will provide even more protein. And I also put other dairy products (soybean products) to even increase the variety of the diet of vegetarians. In the last, although a lot of people heard of this, I still want to point out other benefits of being vegetarian such as healthier/ less carbon footprint. 
- Audience:  The primary audience of this project are those who wants to try becoming vegetarian but limited by food choice. 



## Initial sketches

> A link to the publicly-accessible datasets you plan on using, or a link to a copy of the data you've uploaded to your Github repository, Box account or other publicly-accessible location. Using a datasource that is already publicly accessible is highly encouraged.  If you anticipate using a data source other than something that would be publicly available please talk to me first.
